Hello!
This updated version is now fully PHP 4.2.0 compliant.
If you experience problems with this version since your server hasn't
been updated, use the hangman_old.php file which is the previous
version of my game.
At the moment the file that contains the words is parole.txt which
is enclosed.
You can change the name file in the PHP code or all the words in this
file.
Images are now included and were taken from

Please let me know that you're using my script by writing me at
giovanni@libero.it
If you want to make any improvement, write me.
I'll be more than happy to help you or to read your suggestions.
If you need help, contact me at

See ya,
Giovanni
